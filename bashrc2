# Many systems have some default .bashrc that I don't want to override.
# Therefore, this is a separate bashrc file that should be included in
# the main bashrc with the following:
# 	if [ -f ".bashrc2" ];
# 	then
# 	  source ".bashrc2"
# 	  fi
# It's unfortunate that there's a manual installation step - in future, perhaps
# I could search the bashrc for this and if it doesn't exist, append it.
